# Project Guidelines — Master Template

> This file is managed by the Claude.md Master Utility.
> Do NOT edit this file directly in projects — edits will be overwritten on next sync.
> To add shared content: wrap additions in `<!-- SHARED:START -->` / `<!-- SHARED:END -->` markers,
> then commit. The sync utility will extract them and add them to the master.
> For project-specific notes, use `PROJECT_CLAUDE.md` instead.

## Code Structure

- Follow consistent project structure conventions.
- Keep business logic separated from infrastructure/framework code.
- Prefer flat directory structures over deeply nested ones.

## Logging

- Use structured logging (key-value pairs) rather than unstructured string messages.
- Include correlation/request IDs in log entries for traceability.
- Log at appropriate levels: DEBUG for development, INFO for operational events, WARN for recoverable issues, ERROR for failures requiring attention.
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII).

## Error Handling

- Handle errors at the appropriate boundary — don't swallow exceptions silently.
- Provide meaningful error messages that help diagnose the issue.
- Distinguish between user-facing errors and internal errors.

## Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code; add comments only when the "why" isn't obvious.
- Keep functions focused — single responsibility.
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.

## Dependencies

- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds.
- Evaluate dependencies carefully — prefer well-maintained, widely-used libraries.
- Keep dependencies up to date with regular audits.

## Testing

- Write tests for business logic and edge cases.
- Tests should be independent and not rely on execution order.
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.

## Git Commit Conventions

- Use conventional commits format: type(scope): description

- Keep subject line under 72 characters
